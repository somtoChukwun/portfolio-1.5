# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

* `npm start` Runs the app in the development mode.\
* `npm test`
* `npm run build` Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\ It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
